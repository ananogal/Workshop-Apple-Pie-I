# Apple Pie

## About
In this word-guessing game, the player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.


### Step 5: Challenge 1

- Create three more buttons “C”, “D” and “E”.
- Set buttons to be 20 pixels from the top and 30 from the left.
- Set their background colour to different colours so you can see their size.
